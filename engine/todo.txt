need to improve fps reporting as setting test to 3500fps reports ~2500fps but few overbudget warnings...

need to clean up interface classes
	- create application class (Windows implementation will be Win32 type application)
	- don't want implementation details in interface as this leads to common dependencies
	- need to move as much stuff into engine layer as possible to minimise public exposure
	- need a way to create a new log
	- go through all abstract interfaces and 'de-virtualise' as much as possible!
	
kernel systems
even though kernel will (ultimately) have memory management, it must not rely on any dynamic memory
	- should be able to instantiate everything at the kernel level statically (I think... think more on this)
	
need unit tests for systems

need another timer class for profiling
