need to clean up interface classes
	- don't want implementation details in interface as this leads to common dependencies
	- need to move as much stuff into engine layer as possible to minimise public exposure
	* itime.h - DONE		
	- move filename functionality into file class
		- maybe need a way of forcing output to be ascii even if unicode program; or unicode if ascii?
		* creating file system interface - DONE
		* add newline to each logfile output - DONE
		* need some macros to make logging easier - DONE
	
kernel systems
even though kernel will (ultimately) have memory management, it must not rely on any dynamic memory
	- should be able to instantiate everything at the kernel level statically (I think... think more on this)
	
need unit tests for systems

need another timer class for profiling
